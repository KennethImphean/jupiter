# Jupiter

_A tool to find ways to get involved on campus._

## Getting Started

This project requires a working [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installation
(at least v14) with NPM, which comes bundled with Node.js (at least v8). (If you
use Yarn, that's fine, too. Just beware of the commands.)

First, clone the repository.

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/UTDNebula/jupiter.git
```

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
